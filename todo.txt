backup from a named instance? not implemented
Needs a completion message with stats: MB/s, MB read, MB written, compression ratio, etc
restore on top of an existing database? no error message
rate doesn't print out its config
package version number does not match assembly's version number.
cntl-c kills the app, but we can handle the event: http://www.codeneverwritten.com/2006/10/ctrl-c-and-net-console-application.html


does it work w/ SQL express?
does it do log backups? yes, needs documenation
does it restore from a zip and naming the internal file? yes


document:
only works on the same machine as SQL Server
how to do log backups
which compression should I use?  How do they compare?



roadmap:
connect to a SQL Server named instance
gui
when overwriting a file, don't destroy/recreate, but overwrite in place to preserve a defraged file.
striped backups
threading: request the next block from SQL Server while another thread is compressing
remove the SQL injection attack
encryption plugin
