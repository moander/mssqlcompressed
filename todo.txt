backup from a named instance? not implemented
Needs a completion message with stats: MB/s, MB read, MB written, compression ratio, etc
restore on top of an existing database? no error message
rate doesn't print out its config
package version number does not match assembly's version number.

does it work w/ SQL express?
does it do log backups? yes, needs documenation
does it restore from a zip and naming the internal file? yes


document:
only works on the same machine as SQL Server
how to do log backups
which compression should I use?  How do they compare?



roadmap:
connect to a SQL Server named instance
gui
when overwriting a file, don't destroy/recreate, but overwrite in place to preserve a defraged file.
striped backups
threading: request the next block from SQL Server while another thread is compressing
remove the SQL injection attack
encryption plugin
